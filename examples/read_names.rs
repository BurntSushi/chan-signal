// This example demonstrates how to do something almost useful with OS signals.
// This program asks the user to inputs names. It then outputs these names
// once the user inputs EOF. The catch is that it will *also* output these
// names if the user sends the process SIGINT or SIGTERM.
//
// This is hard or impossible to do with regular asynchronous signal handlers.
// But with a channel based API, it's easy to integrate with the rest of
// your control flow.
